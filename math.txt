This document will contain a basic overview of some of the math and statistics used throughout the application.

Initial statistics:

Team Stat ranking score:

Hv = highest value for stat in league
Lv = lowest value for stat in league
Tv = team being calculated stat for league

ranking score = (Tv-Lv)/(Hv-Lv)

Adjusted SoS:
This statistic will tell us how hard a teams schedule is the highest possible schedule value is currently 1.12875.

OAR = Opponents adjusted record.
O2AR = Opponents Opponents adjusted record
O3AR = opponents opponents adjusted record.
Loff = location offset currently 1 for neutral site, .95 for home for team whos SoS is being calculated and 1.05 for away for team whos SoS is being calculated 
Coff = conference adjustment is the adjustment based on the teams conference current 1.075 for SEC, 1.05 for other P5 or Notre Dame, 1 for G5 teams, and .5 for FCS teams.

W = teams number of wins
L = teams number of losses 

OAR for a team is calculated as (W/(W+L))*Loff*Coff.
A teams O2AR is calculated as the sum of all their opponents OARs/# of opponents
A teams O3AR is calculated as the sum of all their opponents opponents OARs/# of opponents opponents.

SoS is the sum of across a teams opponent's for each team (5*OAR+2*O2AR+O3AR)/8 divided by the number of opponents.

Example 
All teams are G5 all games neutral site for simplicity sake.
Team A played Team B (1-1) and Team C(1-1)
Team B played Team A (2-0) and Team D(0-2)
Team C played Team A (2-0) and Team E(1-1)
Team D played Team B (1-1) and Team E(2-0)
Team E played Team C (1-1) and Team D(0-2)

We want to calculate Team As SoS so first we get Team B and Team C's OAR in this case 0.5 each since there is no offset.  Next we calculate Team Bs O2AR which is 1 + 0 / 2 or .5.  Team Cs O2AR would be 1 + .5 / 2 or .75.  Finally we calculate Team Bs O3AR which means looking at teams team Bs opponents have played.  For team B we get (.5 + .5 + .5 + 1) = .625.  For team C we do the same and get .5 + .5 + .5 + 0 = .375.  Finally we put these together.  From team B combined we get (5*.5 + 2*.5 + .625)/8 = .765265.  from Team C combined we get (5*.5+2*.75+.375) = 0.546875.  We combine these and get a final SoS of  .765265 + 0.546875 = 0.65607.
